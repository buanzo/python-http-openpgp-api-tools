# python-http-openpgp-api-tools
A wrapper to python-requests to support openpgp encapsulation, and corresponding server-side proxy code

## Introduction

This repository contains tools and modules that implement the client and
server side of an OpenPGP-encapsulated HTTP API methodology.

The code is insecure, and is a proof of concept that I expect someone might
find useful. The Mkit company (https://mkit.com) has gladly sponsored the
creation of this code, and has allowed me on 2018-May-14 to open source it
for the benefit of the open source and security communities.

Cheers.
Buanzo.
